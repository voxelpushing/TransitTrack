# TransitTrack

TransitTrack does what it says, it tracks transit vehicles. Simply enter the number of the vehicle that you're on, and the app will record vehicle information including:

* Vehicle Route
* Vehicle Number
* Current Time
* Vehicle Direction
* Vehicle Location

All past results are also right at your fingertips for review.

*Note: currently the app only supports vehicle tracking for the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC). To test the app, try vehicle numbers 4500, 3411, or 4004.*

#### Installation

Build using Android Studio, your device needs to be API level 23 or higher.

---

The goal is for this app is to be an utility for anyone taking transit. Things planned include:

* Supporting many more transit agencies
* Providing information about the model of vehicle tracked
* Attachments to indivdual records (e.g. notes, images)
* Showing nearby points of interest
