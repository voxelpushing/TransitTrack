# TransitTrack

TransitTrack does what it says, it tracks transit vehicles. Simply enter the number of the vehicle that you're on, and the app will record vehicle information including:

* Vehicle Route
* Vehicle Number
* Current Time
* Vehicle Direction
* Vehicle Location

All past results are also right at your fingertips for review.

*Note: currently the app only supports vehicle tracking for the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC). To test the app, try vehicle numbers 4500, 3411, or 4004.*

#### Installation

Build using Android Studio, your device needs to be API level 23 or higher.

The goal is for this app is to be an utility for anyone taking transit. Things planned include:

* Supporting many more transit agencies
* Providing information about the model of vehicle tracked
* Attachments to indivdual records (e.g. notes, images)
* Showing nearby points of interest
